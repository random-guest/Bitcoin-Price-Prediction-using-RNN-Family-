# Bitcoin Price Prediction in the time of Russia-Ukarine War using RNN Family 

# Aim
1. predict next day closing price of Bitcoin.
2. study the effects of Russia-Ukarine tweets on the performance (perhaps something new).
3. compare the effects of using Technical Indicators, Bitcoin tweets and Russia-Ukarine tweets on the performance of the implemented models.

# Models Used
1. LSTM
2. 1D-Conv-LSTM
3. Bi-LSTM
4. 1D-Conv-Bi-LSTM
5. GRU
6. 1D-Conv-GRU
7. Bi-GRU
8. 1D-Conv-Bi-GRU

# Data Used
1. Historical Bitcoin data (open, high, low, close, volume)
2. Technical Indicators (Moving Average - MA, Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD, Exponential Moving Average - EMA, Bollinger bands, Momentum).
3. Bitcoin Tweets
4. Russia-Ukarine War Tweets

# Future Work
1. Model wise: Add state-of-the-art model that utlizes Transformer architecture.
2. Data wise: Apply feature engineering.
