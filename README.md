# Bitcoin Price Prediction in the time of Russia-Ukraine War using LSTM.

# Research Question
1. Is the bitcoin price affected by the Russia-Ukraine War?
2. Can we use Social Sentiments to predict economic destabilization?

# Data Used
1. Recent Historical Bitcoin data (open, high, low, close, volume) of daily data between 2021-01-01 and 2022-07-01.
2. Technical Indicators (Moving Average - MA, Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD, Exponential Moving Average - EMA, Bollinger bands, Momentum).
3. Recent Bitcoin Tweets (21k tweets were analyzed between 2021-01-01 and 2022-07-01).
4. Recent Russian-Ukraine War Tweets (30 k tweets were analyzed between 2021-01-01 and 2022-07-01).

# Model Used
Long-Short-Term-Memory Model (LSTM).

# Future Work
