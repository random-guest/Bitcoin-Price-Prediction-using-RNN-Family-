# Term Project: Bitcoin Price Prediction
This repo is meant to keep track of the progress of completing the term project.
The data that will be used is attached.
The data is in the form of Open-High-Low-Close-Volume data-type for Bitcoin prices between 2013 and 2021.
# Updates/Comments
1. The tunned version of the first model was completed and uploaded. The MAE dropped from 1502 to 776, while the RMSE dropped from 3403 to 1564.
The result is still to be improved. The next week work will be focusing on adding a 1-D convolutional layer to this model.
# Feedback

# Critical note
The models fails to predict sudden change in the price.
