# Bitcoin Price Prediction in the time of Russia-Ukarine War using RNN Family 

# Aim
To predict next day closing price of Bitcoin.

# Potential Contribuation 
Study the effects of Russia-Ukarine war tweets on the price (something that I didn't find it done so far).

# Models Used
1. LSTM
2. 1D-Conv-LSTM
3. Bi-LSTM
4. 1D-Conv-Bi-LSTM
5. GRU
6. 1D-Conv-GRU
7. Bi-GRU
8. 1D-Conv-Bi-GRU

# Data Used
1. Historical Bitcoin data (open, high, low, close, volume)
2. Technical Indicators (Moving Average - MA, Moving Average Convergence Divergence - MACD, Exponential Moving Average - EMA, Bollinger bands, Momentum).
3. Bitcoin Tweets
4. Russia-Ukarine War Tweets
